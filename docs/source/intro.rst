What is this about?
-------------------

This is the documentation to **plyr**, a Wrapper around **libglyr**, a library for finding and downloading
all sort of music-related metadata from a collection of providers. It's written in C and therefore available 
for musicplayers written directly in that language, or for programs that used the commandline interface **glyrc**.

libglyr:

libglyr's API doc:

.. note::
   
   This Wrapper is beta-software. It may blow your computer totally unexcpted.

Installing
----------

Install *cython* if not done yet: ::

   sudo pip install cython

Build & install the Wrapper: ::

   git clone git://github.com/sahib/python-glyr.git
   cd python-glyr
   sudo python setup.py install

Documentation
-------------

Silly question. You're looking at it. 
But when we're on it: There are only a few chapters, since there
is not so much to cover. Every chapter is split into a description,
and a reference. After all those theory chapters you are going to be rewarded
by some practical examples.

Please have fun.
